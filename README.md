# City Explorer

**Author**: Kevin LaMarca
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
- This app is designed to take in a location via user input, make an API call requesting data on the location, and render a map of the user's selected location.

## Getting Started
1. create a new react app
2. link app to github remote repo
3. establish state with constructor func
4. create form, attach event listener to form onSubmit, create event handler func that saves user input to state
5. create async API call function; makes the request, inserts the user input into the URL passed into axios.get(). The func then awaits the server response and saves it to state, 
6. 

## Architecture
- The app will be written in JS, CSS and HTML using React. An API will also be called upon to provide location based data for rendering via async function which will then save the data in state.
